1. check if req.body.tokens are readable on client
2. complete user endpoints w/ authenticated ROUTES
3. rest of endpoints

FIX ERRORS:
1. check how to ON DELETE CASCADE record_entry (they currently don't hold primary keys) [FIXED]
2. SELECT WHERE condition 'col_val' does not exist i.e. SELECT * FROM "users" WHERE "user_type" != "Admin" (in /users/getUsers)
